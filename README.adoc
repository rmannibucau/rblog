== Configuration location/format

Configuration uses properties format (java.util.Properties). Read locations are (sorted):

- `rblog.properties` in the classloader of the application
- `${rblog.base}/conf/rblog.properties` or  `${openejb.base}/conf/rblog.properties` if exist

== Attachments

By default RBlog tries to embed as much as possible but there is an attachment service you can use for custom files.

In that case you will need to activated on your server the multi part without an explicit configuration. For tomcat/tomee just add/create a `context.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<Context allowCasualMultipartParsing="true" />
----

== Max text size

Fe things will limit the max size of the content of a post depending where you deploy. Here are few hints to check:

- MySQL: by default OpenJPA would use `TEXT` which limits the size to 64k which would be quite small if you embed images in the posts. To fix it alter the column:

[source,sql]
----
alter table rblog_post modify content mediumtext;
----

- TomEE: by default tomee 7.0.0 johnzon setup will limit JSON string content to 4k so ensure t adjust it (7.0.1 will accept a bit more):

[source]
----
# whatever fits your need, number of chars
org.apache.johnzon.max-string-length = 655360
----

== Social networks integration

Today RBlog supports Twitter integration. When you create a post you can define a tweet and schedule it to be
posted when the post is published.

== Bit.ly integration

If you configure Bit.ly (`token` property, see configuration) you will be able to hit a `Bit.ly` button on the post
form to automatically retrieve a bit.ly url.

== Mail backup

Often for small or personal blogs the best backup is a mail box (avoid to need a custom server).

When activated configuring `sessionJndi` and `to` properties, that's what will do the backup feature.

NOTE: it needs a valid session configuration, here is a sample for gmail:

[source,xml]
----
<Resource id="mail/gmail" type="javax.mail.Session">
mail.transport.protocol = smtp
mail.smtp.host = smtp.gmail.com
mail.smtp.port = 587
mail.smtp.auth = true
mail.smtp.starttls.enable = true
mail.smtp.user = xxxxx
password = xxxxxx
</Resource>
----

Then on tomee you can set `rblog.backup.mail.sessionJndi` to `openejb:Resource/mail/gmail`.

== Possible Enhancements

(feel free to PR ;))

- [enhancement] write endpoints should use a nested tx to ensure to commit before returning a value
- [feature] theme/theming (hardcoded today)
- [feature] Support of Markdown and potentially Asciidoctor (optional and async start cause JRuby by default would be a pain) syntax
- [feature] Attachement GUI and linkage in the content
- [feature] TomEE Embedded fat jar (`java -jar rblog.jar` or `java -jar rblog.war` or `java -jar tomee-embedded.jar --path rblog.war`)
- [feature] TomEE distribution (pre-packaged rblog zip: `unzip rblog.zip && cd rblog-version && ./bin/startup.sh`) or openshift setup
- ...

== Build

Don't forget to setup chrome and chromedriver and point chromedriver through the maven property `chrome.driver` (can be done in a activated by default profile in settings.xml):
